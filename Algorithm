Below is the basic algorithm: 
for i: 1 to 10 do 
  if calleduserid not in friends[i] then 
    print ('This person may be unknown - you can only place a call with them if you ddd them to your friends list. Reply Y to add them to your friends list')
  endif
  if reply == input('Y') then 
    print ('This person has been added to your friends list')
    friends[i+1] = calleduserid
  else
    print ('Hi, I'm CIVI. How can I help you today?')
  endif
